# Stock Price Prediction and Analysis

Tech stack: Python, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib

#Stock Price Prediction:
Built a Machine Learning model based on a multi-layer Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture for predicting future stock price movements using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM).

#Stock Price Analysis:
Performed regression analysis to investigate and analyze stock indicators which indeed gave us insights on how stock prices react on significant corporate event dates and non-event dates, thus helping investors for making better data-driven investment decisions.
